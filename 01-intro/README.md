# TypeScript Overview

TypeScript is a **superset of JavaScript** that brings optional static typing(statically typed language) and future JavaScript(dynamically typed language) features to today's development workflow.

## 🔧 How It Works

* TypeScript code is written using the `.ts` file extension.
* It is compiled into plain JavaScript using the `tsc` (TypeScript Compiler).
* The resulting JavaScript code can be executed on any platform that supports JavaScript.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

* **Syntax**: TypeScript uses all JavaScript syntax and extends it with type annotations and interfaces.
* **Compatibility**: All valid JavaScript code is valid TypeScript code, but not all TypeScript code is valid JavaScript.

## ❓ Why TypeScript?

* ✅ **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile-time instead of runtime.
* 🚀 **Productivity**: Better autocompletion, navigation, and refactoring support in editors.
* 🔮 **Future-Proof**: Supports upcoming JavaScript features before they are widely available.

TypeScript enhances code quality, maintainability, and team collaboration—especially in large codebases.
